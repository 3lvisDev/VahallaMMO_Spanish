# Smithing üõ†
**Description**<br>
Smithing is your proficiency in tool/armor making. The higher quality equipment you make, the better their properties.<br>
These properties can include armor value, durability, damage, attack speed, and projectile velocity. Potentially others if your server has configured it so. 

**How to gain EXP**<br>
Crafting any tool or equipment. The more expensive the material and the more of it spent, the more EXP you get.

**Special Notes**<br>
Crafting tools with materials far above your level will decrease the experience gained from it, as well as crafting with materials too far below your level. 
<br>‚ùó For each tier apart, EXP is halved. (e.g. at level 40(iron/gold tier), stone and diamond are halved, wood and netherite are quartered)<br>

Equipment gets a grading when it's crafted, which is based on the quality. <br>
Quality is determined by adding your general skill to your proficiency with a certain material. <br>
0-49 = **Poor** <br>
50-99 = **Decent** <br>
100-149 = **Great** <br>
150-199 = **Epic** <br>
200-249 = **Legendary** <br>
250-299 = _**Divine**_ <br>
300+ = _**Incomprehensible**_<br>

# Enchanting üéá
**Description**<br>
Enchanting is your proficiency in... Enchanting. The higher your skill in enchanting, the higher enchantment levels you are able to achieve and the stronger certain equipment upgrades can get. Eventually your enchantments will break vanilla boundaries.

**How to gain EXP**<br>
You get experience through enchanting items. EXP is based on the rarity of these enchantments and their level. For example, Thorns III gives far more experience than Sharpness III. 

**Special Notes**<br>
Even level 30 enchantments will have their strength greatly reduced, and so it is not recommended to level enchanting with 3rd level enchantments.<br> To save on experience, I recommend using 1st level enchantments in the early game. <br>

"Critical strikes" are different from vanilla critical strikes. Vanilla critical strikes which are done by falling while attacking are now referred to as "Power attacks", which still do the usual 1.5x damage. Valhalla's critical strikes occur separately from this, which apply an additional damage multiplier.

# Archery üèπ 
**Description**<br>
Archery is your proficiency in ranged combat. The higher your skill in archery, the more damage you'll deal with bows and crossbows and the more accurate you can shoot. Archery is one of the hardest classes to get started in due to decreased accuracy, but offer some of the highest damage numbers once leveled.

**How to gain EXP**<br>
You get experience for every shot you hit, which further increases based on the damage you dealt with that shot AND the distance between you and the target. 

**Special Notes**<br>
Damage is further influenced by your distance from the target, so short-ranged shorts do much less damage than long-ranged sniper shots.
The Infinity enchantment is nerfed, making it so you deal 30% less damage with normal arrows. Custom arrows are not preserved with infinity, but it does provide an increased chance to not consume ammo.
Ammo preserved using the "decreased ammo consumption" stat cannot be picked up again.

# Light Armor üîπ
**Description**<br>
Light Armor represents how well you are able to protect yourself using less protective, but lighter armor. Light Armor doesn't slow you down as much as Heavy Armor and is better for the player that prefers staying mobile and being able to get away from situations easier, but is less effective against damage protection. 

**How to gain EXP**<br>
You gain EXP for every point of damage you take. This is before mitigations, so having an increased armor value does not decrease EXP. You gain additional EXP for every second you're in combat, and this exp is granted when leaving combat. All this experience is multiplied by the amount of pieces of light armor you're wearing. 

**Special Notes**<br>
By default, light armor slows you down for 3.75% per piece, or 15% with a full set. This movement speed penalty can be reduced, or removed entirely, through perk investment. Light armor does not provide any additional protections beyond armor value.

# Heavy Armor üî∂
**Description**<br>
Heavy Armor represents how well you are able to protect yourself using highly protective, but heavier armor. Heavy Armor significantly slows you down but is much better for the player that prefers staying in battle and dealing as much damage as they can, but will put you at a disadvantage should you ever need to retreat. 

**How to gain EXP**<br>
You gain EXP for every point of damage you take. This is before mitigations, so having an increased armor value does not decrease EXP. You gain additional EXP for every second you're in combat, and this exp is granted when leaving combat. All this experience is multiplied by the amount of pieces of heavy armor you're wearing. 

**Special Notes**<br>
By default, heavy armor slows you down for 7.5% per piece, or 30% with a full set. This movement speed penalty can be reduced through perk investment. Heavy armor provides an additional 5% projectile damage reduction, 2.5% melee damage reduction, 5% knockback reduction and 5% bleeding damage reduction for every piece of heavy armor worn.
