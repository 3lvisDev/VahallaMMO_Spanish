First off, you pretty much always want to start unlocking your **Novice Smithing** perk, as this makes your wooden tools significantly better.

You can even, if you want to, craft some leather armor which significantly increases your survive-ability in case you struggle with that. <br>
Use **/skills** and navigate to the Smithing tab, there, unlock Novice Smithing.

When you just start a game it is not recommended to dive into a cave right away for mining, as your only real available tools will be made of wood and stone. Iron and above will not be of sufficient quality to get decent use out of.<br>

If you want to focus on good gear right away, collect a stack or two of wooden logs and a couple stacks of cobblestone. Using these, craft wooden pickaxes until you reach level 20, unlock **Apprentice Smithing**, and then stone pickaxes until you reach level 40. In **/skills** you can now unlock **Adept Smithing**, and once you've done this your iron and gold equipment will be of significantly higher quality. <br>

Don't forget to temper your tools!
Once you've done that it is much safer to explore cave systems.
